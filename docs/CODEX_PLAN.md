# Codex Plan

## Completed
- **Background enrichment runner & HUD (2025-02-24)**
  - Persist enrichment sessions in Dexie `settings` table and resume in paused state after reload.
  - Minimal top-line HUD + corner controller reflects progress, pause/resume, cancel.
  - Import Wizard decoupled from runner; users can hide modal while enrichment continues.
- **OpenCritic via RapidAPI (2025-02-24)**
  - Desktop command reads `OPENCRITIC_API_KEY`/`OPENCRITIC_HOST`, hits `/game/search` and `/game/{id}`, and caches results for 7 days under `%AppData%/GameTracker/opencritic_cache.json`.
  - 429 responses respect `Retry-After` or fall back to a 700 ms + jitter sleep.
  - Web bridge and Library/Import flows round scores and persist them on `Identity`.
- **HLTB Next.js integration (2025-02-25)**
  - Desktop derives the build id from `__NEXT_DATA__`, caches it for 24h, and queries `_next/data/<build-id>/search.json` for gameplayMain values (apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/commands.rs:208).
  - Fuzzy scoring + HTML JSON fallback keep legacy regex as last resort; caches log hits/misses via DEBUG_HLTB.

## Next
1. **Abortable desktop bridge calls** - Owner: Desktop team - Target: 2025-03-05
   - Tauri commands (`hltb_search`, `get_steam_price_try`, `get_opencritic_score`) accept cancellation tokens and abort promptly.
   - Web bridge forwards `AbortSignal`; runner marks row `Paused` immediately on abort.
   - Manual QA: pause mid-request stops network call; resume restarts without duplicate writes.
2. **HUD visibility toggle** - Owner: Web - Target: 2025-03-07
   - Settings page exposes "Show enrichment HUD" switch persisted via Dexie settings.
   - HUD hides instantly when disabled and reappears when enabled without reload.
   - Regression check: import enrichment still runs when HUD hidden; users can reopen wizard from Library.
3. **Cancel & reset UX polish** - Owner: Web - Target: 2025-03-10
   - "Cancel" clears queue, Dexie session, and removes HUD within one tick.
   - Wizard surfaces confirmation with summary of partially enriched rows before reset.
   - Add smoke QA checklist covering cancelâ†’re-import flow and ensure no residual status rows remain.
4. **Cache management UI** - Owner: Desktop team - Target: 2025-03-12
   - Settings surface "Clear HLTB token/cache" alongside OpenCritic cache management.
   - Actions remove `%AppData%/GameTracker/hltb_build.json`, `hltb_cache.json`, and `opencritic_cache.json`, emitting toast feedback.
5. **HLTB resilience** - Owner: Desktop team - Target: 2025-03-17
   - Handle alternate build-id patterns (e.g., inline chunk names) and fall back to HEAD/manifest probing if parsing fails.
   - Add a weekly probe task hitting the `_next/data` endpoint with three titles; alert on structure changes.
6. **OpenCritic disambiguation UX** - Owner: Web - Target: 2025-03-19
   - When multiple close matches return, present a picker (title + year) before committing the score.
   - Runner logs the chosen `id` to cache to avoid repeated prompts; allow "use first result" as default preference.
